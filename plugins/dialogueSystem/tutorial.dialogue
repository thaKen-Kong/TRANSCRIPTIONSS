	Nucleolus:
	    Welcome, researcher! This is the nucleus. 
	    Our goal is to transcribe DNA into mRNA.
	    First, let’s find the promoter region (TATA box) on the DNA strand.
	- Ok, Show Me:
	    Nucleolus:
	        Look for the TATA box. Approach it to start.
	do TutorialManager.dna._on_interact_pre_initiation()
	- Skip:
	    Nucleolus:
	        You can explore the DNA yourself.
	=> initiation_phase

	~ initiation_phase
	Nucleolus:
	    Great! Now, drag the RNA polymerase to the promoter region to start transcription.
	- Got It:
	    Nucleolus:
	        Perfect! This initiates the transcription process.
	do TutorialManager.dna._on_drop_place_object_placed(active_rnap)
	- Need Help:
	    Nucleolus:
	        Remember, you can grab the RNA polymerase with 'E' and place it on the promoter.
	=> elongation_phase

	~ elongation_phase
	Nucleolus:
	    Excellent! Watch the RNA polymerase move along the DNA. 
	    It reads the DNA sequence and builds mRNA.
	- Watch:
	    Nucleolus:
	        Notice the empty nitrogen base slots. These will be filled with complementary RNA bases.
	do TutorialManager.dna._start_elongation()
	- I Understand:
	    Nucleolus:
	        Good! Observe carefully to understand elongation.
	=> termination_phase

	~ termination_phase
	Nucleolus:
	    Once the RNA polymerase reaches the termination site, a minigame will pop up.
	    Complete it to finish elongation.
	- Ready:
	    Nucleolus:
	        Focus and complete the termination minigame.
		do TutorialManager.dna._finish_elongation()
	- Skip:
	    Nucleolus:
	        You can try the minigame now.
	=> base_pairing_phase

	~ base_pairing_phase
	Nucleolus:
	    Now, let’s transcribe the DNA sequence into mRNA. 
	    Remember the base pairing rules:
	        DNA A → RNA U
	        DNA T → RNA A
	        DNA G → RNA C
	        DNA C → RNA G
	    Complete the base pairing minigame to synthesize mRNA.
	- Got It:
	    Nucleolus:
	        Fill all empty nitrogen base slots according to these rules.
	    do DNA._spawn_mRNA()
	- Need Help:
	    Nucleolus:
	        Take your time, follow the rules carefully.
	=> delivery_phase

	~ delivery_phase
	Nucleolus:
	    Well done! Your mRNA is complete. 
	    Deliver it to the exit site. This is why we call it a "delivery."
	- Deliver:
	    Nucleolus:
	        Drag the packaged mRNA to the exit site.
	    do ExitSite.show()
	- Not Yet:
	    Nucleolus:
	        You can review the mRNA sequence before delivering.
	=> repeat_delivery

	~ repeat_delivery
	Nucleolus:
	    After delivery, repeat the process until all required mRNA deliveries are complete.
	- Continue:
	    Nucleolus:
	        Return to the DNA to start the next transcription.
	    do DNA.restart_transcription()
	=> END
